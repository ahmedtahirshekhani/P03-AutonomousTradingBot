Commented Code Everytime
Update Comment if necessary
Document a function (necessary) - only for necessary functions


Follow same function style
NamingConvention
Avoid using single identifier(variable name) in different functions

* IMPORTANT *
We will be using camelCase for variable naming
eg: newVariable
We will use Pascal for Class and Function name
eg: NewVariable
For constants all CAPITAL
eg: NEWVARIABLE


Avoid Deep Nesting Structure
Maintain proper Folder Structure
Not make function of more than 30 lines (break into multiple functions if lengthy function)
Catch each exception not generic one
Avoid using Global Variables (Please think 10 times before using)
Avoid goto statements


Donot Hardcode the configurations so we will use i18n (Localization and Internationalization) so we can transfer it multilingual later on
Peer Review
Refactor the code (restructure the code)
